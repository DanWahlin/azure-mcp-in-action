## Part 1: Requirements Analysis

**Ask Azure MCP - Architecture Planning**:

```
@azure Help me architect a SaaS application with these requirements:

Users: 10,000 monthly active users
Growth: 20% month-over-month
Traffic: 500K API requests/day
Storage: 100GB data, 1TB files
Database: Multi-tenant SQL data
Availability: 99.9% uptime required
Security: SOC 2 compliance needed
Budget: $500/month initially, scale with revenue

Recommend complete architecture with:
- Compute services
- Data storage
- Networking
- Security
- Monitoring
- Cost optimization strategies
- Scaling plan for growth
```

---

## Part 2: Phased Deployment

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
Deploy core infrastructure for SaaS app:

Networking:
- Virtual Network with subnets
- Private endpoints for all services
- Application Gateway for load balancing
- DDoS protection

Compute:
- Container Apps for API (B1, scale to B2)
- Static Web Apps for frontend
- Function Apps for background jobs

Data:
- Azure SQL Database (S1, read replicas in 2 regions)
- Blob Storage (Hot + lifecycle to Cool)
- Redis Cache (Basic C1)

Security:
- Key Vault for secrets
- Managed identities for all services
- Azure AD B2C for user auth

Resource group: saas-app-prod-rg in East US 2
```

**Note**: [Virtual Network (VNet)](../GLOSSARY.md#virtual-network-vnet) isolates resources. [Key Vault](../GLOSSARY.md#key-vault) secures secrets. [Managed identities](../GLOSSARY.md#managed-identity) eliminate credentials in code.

**Agent mode will**:
1. Generate infrastructure code → Show "Continue?" → Execute after approval
2. Create complete production infrastructure
3. Configure all networking and security
4. Set up compute, data, and security services
5. Apply enterprise-grade configurations and return connection details

---

### Phase 2: Monitoring and Observability

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
Set up production monitoring:

Application Insights:
- Distributed tracing across all services
- Custom metrics for business KPIs
- Availability tests from 5 global locations

Log Analytics:
- Centralized logging for all services
- Custom queries for troubleshooting
- Security audit logs

Alerts:
- Response time > 1 second
- Error rate > 1%
- Database CPU > 80%
- Storage capacity > 80%
- Failed deployments
- Security anomalies

Dashboards:
- Executive dashboard (uptime, users, revenue)
- Operations dashboard (performance, errors, health)
- Cost dashboard (spend by service, trends)

Send alerts to: PagerDuty integration
```

**Note**: [Application Insights](../GLOSSARY.md#application-insights) monitors app performance. [Log Analytics](../GLOSSARY.md#log-analytics) centralizes logging and querying.

---

### Phase 3: Disaster Recovery

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
Implement disaster recovery:

Backups:
- SQL Database: Point-in-time restore (7 days)
- Blob Storage: Geo-redundant (GRS)
- Configuration: Export to Azure DevOps Git

Failover:
- Traffic Manager for multi-region failover
- Standby region in West US 2
- Automated failover testing monthly

Recovery:
- RTO: 4 hours
- RPO: 1 hour
- Documented recovery procedures
```

**Note**: [RTO (Recovery Time Objective)](../GLOSSARY.md#rto-recovery-time-objective) is maximum downtime. [RPO (Recovery Point Objective)](../GLOSSARY.md#rpo-recovery-point-objective) is maximum data loss.

---

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline

Generate GitHub Actions workflow for:
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security scanning (secrets, dependencies)
- Infrastructure deployment (Bicep templates)
- Application deployment (blue-green)
- Smoke tests after deployment
- Automatic rollback on failure

---

## Part 3: Cost Optimization

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
Analyze current costs and generate optimization plan:

1. Identify underutilized resources
2. Recommend reserved instances for stable workloads
3. Configure auto-shutdown for dev/test resources
4. Implement storage lifecycle policies
5. Set up budgets and alerts
6. Generate monthly cost reports

Target: Reduce costs by 30% without impacting performance
```

---

## Part 4: Security Hardening

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
Harden security for production:

1. Enable Azure Security Center recommendations
2. Implement network security groups (least privilege)
3. Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF)
4. Enable DDoS protection
5. Set up Azure Sentinel for threat detection
6. Configure audit logging for compliance
7. Implement secret rotation policies
8. Enable vulnerability scanning

Implement all recommendations for saas-app-prod-rg
```

**Note**: [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](../GLOSSARY.md#web-application-firewall-waf) protects against common web exploits and vulnerabilities.

**Agent mode will**:
1. Generate security configuration code → Show "Continue?" → Execute after approval
2. Configure all security hardening measures
3. Apply least-privilege security policies
4. Enable threat detection and monitoring
5. Set up compliance logging and return security configuration summary

---

## Part 5: Documentation and Handoff

Create comprehensive documentation:
1. Architecture diagrams (network, application, data flow)
2. Deployment runbooks
3. Troubleshooting guides
4. Cost analysis and optimization recommendations
5. Disaster recovery procedures
6. Monitoring and alerting documentation
7. Security compliance checklist
8. Knowledge transfer materials for operations team

## Cleanup Using Azure MCP

**🎉 CONGRATULATIONS ON COMPLETING THE CAPSTONE!**

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a complete production environment. The cleanup process is more complex.

### Decision Point: Keep or Delete?

#### Option A: Keep as Portfolio Project (Recommended)

If this is your capstone and you want to showcase it:

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
Scale down saas-app-prod-rg resources to minimal tiers:
- Downgrade App Service to F1 Free tier
- Downgrade SQL Database to Basic tier
- Downgrade Redis to Basic C0
- Delete secondary region resources
- Keep monitoring at minimum

Target cost: $20-30/month for portfolio showcase
```

**Agent mode will** generate downgrade commands → ask "Continue?" → downgrade all resources to minimal tiers while keeping the application functional.

#### Option B: Complete Deletion

**Prompt to Azure MCP**:
```
BEFORE deleting, help me:
1. Export SQL database and Blob Storage data
2. List all architecture documentation to save
3. Identify dashboards and metrics to screenshot

Then delete all resources in saas-app-prod-rg and saas-app-dr-rg
```

**Agent mode will**:
1. Generate deletion plan → Show "Continue?" → Execute after approval
2. Guide you through data export
3. Help document what to preserve
4. Delete all production resources
5. Confirm complete removal

**Manual Complete Deletion**:

```bash
# Step 1: BACKUP EVERYTHING
# Export SQL database
az sql db export \
  --resource-group saas-app-prod-rg \
  --server [SERVER] \
  --name [DATABASE] \
  --admin-user [USER] \
  --admin-password [PASSWORD] \
  --storage-uri [BACKUP-URI]

# Download all blobs
az storage blob download-batch \
  --source [CONTAINER] \
  --destination ./capstone-backup \
  --account-name [STORAGE]

# Step 2: Document everything
# Save Application Insights queries
# Export monitoring dashboards
# Download architecture diagrams

# Step 3: Delete resource group
az group delete --name saas-app-prod-rg --yes --no-wait

# Step 4: Delete standby region if created
az group delete --name saas-app-dr-rg --yes --no-wait
```

---

### Verification

**Verify resource groups are gone (Bash/macOS/Linux):**
```bash
az group list --output table | grep saas-app
```

**Verify resource groups are gone (PowerShell/Windows):**
```powershell
az group list --output table | Select-String "saas-app"
```

**Verify billing stops (Bash/macOS/Linux):**
```bash
az consumption usage list --start-date $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

**Verify billing stops (PowerShell/Windows):**
```powershell
az consumption usage list --start-date (Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd")
```

**Final Cost Impact**:
- Complete deletion: $0/month
- Keep as portfolio (scaled down): $20-30/month
- Original production: $500+/month
