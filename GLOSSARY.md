# Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout the Azure Infrastructure with AI Assistance course.

---

## A

### Agent Mode

A mode in GitHub Copilot that acts as an autonomous, real-time collaborator performing multi-step tasks based on natural language prompts. Agent mode can analyze codebases, read files, propose edits, run terminal commands, and iterate on solutions automatically with self-healing capabilities.

**How it works**: Agent mode loops through determining relevant context, offering code changes and terminal commands, monitoring correctness, and iterating to fix issues autonomously.

**What it can do**: Create applications from scratch, refactor across multiple files, write and run tests, migrate code to modern frameworks, install packages, and more.

**In this course**: Used primarily for creating, modifying, and deleting Azure resources through natural language prompts.

**Contrast with**: Ask mode (for questions and learning without taking actions).

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

### App Service

Azure's fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications. Supports multiple languages (Node.js, Python, .NET, Java, PHP) and runtimes without managing underlying infrastructure.

**Why it matters**: One of the simplest ways to deploy web applications to Azure. No server management required.

**Example**: Deploying a Node.js web app on Linux with HTTPS enabled by default.

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

### App Service Plan

The compute resources (CPU, memory, storage) that power your App Service. Multiple apps can share the same plan to reduce costs. Plans have different SKUs (Free, Basic, Standard, Premium) with varying capabilities and pricing.

**Pricing tiers**:
- **F1 (Free)**: $0/month, limited resources, good for learning
- **B1 (Basic)**: ~$13/month, custom domains, SSL
- **S1 (Standard)**: ~$70/month, auto-scaling, deployment slots
- **P1V2 (Premium)**: ~$146/month, better performance, more scaling

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

### Application Insights

Azure's application performance monitoring (APM) service that collects telemetry data about your application's performance, errors, and usage. Provides distributed tracing, custom metrics, and availability tests.

**What it tracks**: Response times, error rates, dependencies, user behavior, custom events.

**See**: [Chapter 8: Diagnostics and Troubleshooting](./08-diagnostics-troubleshooting/README.md)

### Ask Mode

The default mode in GitHub Copilot that provides answers to your questions in the chat pane without modifying code or resources. Ask mode is fast, helpful, and focused entirely on answering questions.

**How it works**: You can highlight code, ask a question in Copilot Chat, and it generates an answer - explaining code, suggesting tests, providing code snippets, or discussing edge cases.

**Chat participants**: Use prefixes like `@azure` to scope questions to specific domains. For example, `@azure` directs questions to the Azure chat participant for Azure-specific knowledge and help.

**In this course**: Used for learning about Azure services, understanding pricing, comparing options, and getting architectural guidance without creating resources.

**Example**: `@azure What is the monthly cost of an F1 App Service plan?`

**Contrast with**: Agent mode (for autonomous multi-step tasks and resource creation).

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

### Auto-scaling

A cloud computing method that dynamically adjusts computational resources automatically based on actual demand, without human intervention. The number of active servers or instances increases when load is high and decreases when activity is low.

**How it works**: Monitors specific metrics (CPU utilization, memory usage, bandwidth, HTTP queue length, custom metrics) and automatically scales resources to match real-time demand according to predefined policies.

**Types of scaling**:
- **Horizontal (scale out/in)**: Adding or removing machines/nodes
- **Vertical (scale up/down)**: Adding or reducing power (RAM, CPU, storage) to existing nodes

**Benefits**:
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay only for resources actually needed; most cloud providers charge based on usage
- **Performance & availability**: Maintains consistent performance regardless of demand
- **Automatic management**: Handles traffic spikes without manual intervention

**Providers**: Available across AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

**See**: [Chapter 6: Containerized Applications](./06-containerized-apps/README.md)

### Azure CLI

The command-line interface for managing Azure resources. Works across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Commands start with `az` and follow the pattern `az <service> <command> <parameters>`.

**Example**: `az group list --output table`

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

### Azure MCP

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation that provides Azure-specific tools and capabilities within the GitHub Copilot for Azure extension. Exposes Azure operations as MCP tools, resources, and prompts that AI agents can use.

**What it does**: Acts as the bridge between GitHub Copilot's AI and your Azure subscription, implementing the MCP standard to enable:
- Azure resource management tools (create, update, delete, query)
- Azure documentation and best practices as resources
- Azure-specific prompt templates
- Automatic authentication, API calls, and command execution

**How it works**: When you use GitHub Copilot agent mode with Azure prompts, Azure MCP translates your natural language requests into Azure CLI commands, Bicep templates, or API calls through the MCP protocol.

**Why it matters**: Enables standardized AI-to-Azure communication, allowing you to describe what you want in natural language without knowing specific commands or APIs.

**See**: [Course Setup](./00-course-setup/README.md#part-4-understanding-model-context-protocol-mcp)

### Azure Container Apps

A serverless container platform that runs containers without managing Kubernetes complexity. Provides auto-scaling, ingress, secrets management, and built-in service discovery.

**When to use**: When you need container orchestration but don't need full Kubernetes features.

**Contrast with**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides full Kubernetes control but requires more management.

**See**: [Chapter 6: Containerized Applications](./06-containerized-apps/README.md)

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure's managed Kubernetes service that provides full control over container orchestration, networking, and scaling. Industry-standard for production container deployments.

**When to use**: Complex microservices, need Kubernetes features, team has Kubernetes expertise.

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Full Kubernetes features and ecosystem
- ✅ Industry-standard, portable across clouds
- ❌ Higher complexity and learning curve
- ❌ More expensive (~$70-100/month minimum)

### Blob Storage

Azure's object storage service for unstructured data like images, videos, documents, and backups. Organized in containers with different access tiers for cost optimization.

**Access tiers**:
- **Hot**: Frequent access, higher storage cost, lower access cost
- **Cool**: Infrequent access (30+ days), lower storage cost
- **Archive**: Rare access (180+ days), lowest storage cost, hours to retrieve

**See**: [Chapter 7: Data Storage Solutions](./07-data-storage/README.md)

---

## C

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)

A distributed network of servers that cache static content (images, CSS, JavaScript) closer to users geographically, reducing latency and improving performance.

**Why it matters**: Faster page loads globally, reduced bandwidth costs, offloads traffic from origin server.

**See**: [Chapter 8: Performance Optimization](./08-diagnostics-troubleshooting/README.md)

### Container Apps Environment

The secure boundary around a group of Container Apps that share the same virtual network, logging workspace, and configuration. Multiple Container Apps within one environment can communicate securely.

**See**: [Chapter 6: Containerized Applications](./06-containerized-apps/README.md)

### Cosmos DB

**Key characteristics**:
- Each slot is a full-fledged App Service instance with a unique hostname
- Slots share the same App Service Plan
- Content and configuration can be swapped between slots

**Common pattern**:
1. Deploy new version to staging slot
2. Test and warm up in staging
3. Swap staging and production slots (near-zero downtime)
4. If issues arise, swap back instantly for rollback

**Requirements**: Available in Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier App Service plans. Free and Basic tiers do not support deployment slots.

**Benefits**: Validate changes before production, eliminate downtime during deployments, instant rollback capability.

**See**: [Chapter 5: Production Web Application](./05-simple-web-app/README.md)

**See**: [Chapter 6: Apache Superset on AKS](./06-containerized-apps/README.md)

### HTTPS-only

A security setting that forces all HTTP traffic to redirect to HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication. Azure App Service enables this by default.

**Why it matters**: Protects data in transit, required for modern web applications, improves SEO.

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

---

## I

### Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

The practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files (code) rather than manual processes, interactive configuration tools, or physical hardware configuration.

**How it works**: Configuration files contain infrastructure specifications (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, connection topologies) which makes it easier to edit, distribute, and version control infrastructure.

**Two approaches**:
- **Declarative**: Describe the desired end state; the tool figures out how to achieve it
- **Imperative**: Define step-by-step commands to set up resources and reach the desired state

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Reproducible and consistent deployments
- ✅ Version control and change history
- ✅ Code review and team collaboration
- ✅ Automated testing and validation
- ✅ Prevents configuration drift and missing dependencies
- ✅ Faster provisioning and scaling

**Popular tools**: Terraform (HashiCorp, multi-cloud), AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager/Bicep, Ansible, Pulumi

**See**: [Chapter 3: Bicep Templates](./03-bicep-templates/README.md), [Chapter 4: Terraform Basics](./04-terraform-basics/README.md)

---

## K

### Key Vault

Azure's service for securely storing and managing secrets (passwords, API keys, certificates, connection strings). Applications access secrets at runtime without hardcoding credentials.

**What it stores**:
- Secrets (passwords, API keys, connection strings)
- Encryption keys
- SSL/TLS certificates

**Why it matters**: Prevents credential exposure in code, centralizes secret management, provides audit logging.

**See**: [Chapter 2: Advanced Prompt Patterns](./02-cli-mastery/README.md)

---

## L

### Lifecycle Policy

Rules that automatically move blob storage data between access tiers (Hot → Cool → Archive) or delete old data based on age. Reduces storage costs without manual intervention.

**Example**: Move files to Cool tier after 30 days, Archive after 180 days, delete after 365 days.

**See**: [Chapter 7: Data Storage Solutions](./07-data-storage/README.md)

### Log Analytics

Azure's service for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing log data from multiple sources. Uses Kusto Query Language (KQL) for powerful log queries.

**What it collects**: Application logs, container logs, performance metrics, security events.

**See**: [Chapter 8: Diagnostics and Troubleshooting](./08-diagnostics-troubleshooting/README.md)

---

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

An open standard, open-source protocol introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 to standardize how AI systems like large language models (LLMs) integrate and share data with external tools, systems, and data sources. Think of it as "USB-C for AI" - providing a universal way to connect AI applications to various services and data sources.

**Core components**: MCP servers expose three primitives to LLMs: Tools (executable functions), Resources (file-like structured data), and Prompts (predefined templates).

**Purpose**: Replaces fragmented custom integrations with a single protocol, helping AI models access data beyond their training - overcoming information silos and legacy systems.

**Adoption**: Officially adopted by OpenAI (March 2025) across ChatGPT, Agents SDK, and APIs. Google DeepMind confirmed support in Gemini models (April 2025). Pre-built MCP servers available for Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Postgres, and more.

**In this course**: GitHub Copilot for Azure uses MCP to communicate with Azure services behind the scenes.

**Why it matters**: Makes skills transferable across MCP-enabled tools and represents the emerging industry standard for AI tool integration.

**See**: [Course Setup - Part 4](./00-course-setup/README.md#part-4-understanding-model-context-protocol-mcp), [Azure MCP](./GLOSSARY.md#azure-mcp)

### Managed Identity

An identity in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) automatically managed by Azure. Allows Azure services to authenticate to other Azure services without storing credentials in code.

**Types**:
- **System-assigned**: Created with the resource, deleted when resource is deleted
- **User-assigned**: Created independently, can be shared across resources

**Why it matters**: Eliminates the need for connection strings and credentials in code, improves security, simplifies access management.

**Example**: App Service uses managed identity to access Key Vault secrets without storing credentials.

**See**: [Chapter 2: Advanced Prompt Patterns](./02-cli-mastery/README.md)

---

## P

### PostgreSQL Flexible Server

**See**: [Chapter 8: Performance Optimization](./08-diagnostics-troubleshooting/README.md)

### Resource Group

A logical container that holds related Azure resources for an application or project. Resources in a group share the same lifecycle and can be managed together.

**Best practices**:
- One resource group per environment (dev, staging, prod)
- Use naming conventions (`projectname-environment-rg`)
- Delete entire resource group to clean up all contained resources

**Example**: `learning-rg-abc` contains App Service, App Service Plan, and database for a learning project.

**See**: [Chapter 1: First Deployment](./01-first-deployment/README.md)

### RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

The maximum acceptable time your application can be down after a disaster before business impact becomes unacceptable.

**Example**: RTO of 4 hours means the application must be restored within 4 hours of an outage.

**See**: [Chapter 10: Production Deployment](./10-production-deployment/README.md)

### RPO (Recovery Point Objective)

The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. Determines how frequently you need backups.

**Example**: RPO of 1 hour means you can lose at most 1 hour of data, requiring at least hourly backups.

**See**: [Chapter 10: Production Deployment](./10-production-deployment/README.md)
