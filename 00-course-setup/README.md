# Chapter 0: Course Setup and Safety Fundamentals

**Title**: Setting Up for Safe, Cost-Effective Azure Learning
**Focus**: Installation, configuration, cost management, and security baseline
**Prerequisites**: Computer with VS Code, valid email for Azure account

---

## Learning Objectives

- ✅ Create an Azure free account with $200 credit and billing protection
- ✅ Install and configure [GitHub Copilot for Azure](../GLOSSARY.md#github-copilot-for-azure) extension (provides [Azure MCP](../GLOSSARY.md#azure-mcp) and more)
- ✅ Set up cost alerts and spending limits
- ✅ Establish security baseline with least-privilege principles
- ✅ Understand [Azure MCP](../GLOSSARY.md#azure-mcp) interaction modes and when to use each
- ✅ Test your setup with first AI-generated commands
- ✅ Create emergency cleanup procedures

## Why This Chapter Matters

> Before writing a single line of infrastructure code, you need guardrails. This chapter sets up financial protection (cost alerts), security defaults ([managed identities](../GLOSSARY.md#managed-identity)), and emergency procedures (cleanup scripts).

## Real-World Scenario

You've been asked to explore Azure for your company's upcoming cloud migration. Management has approved a $100 learning budget, but they're concerned about surprise bills and security issues. You need to set up a safe learning environment where you can experiment with Azure MCP to create resources, but with strict cost controls and the ability to quickly clean up everything if needed.

## Part 1: Azure Account Setup

### Choose Your Azure Subscription

You have two options for this course:

#### Option A: Use an Existing Azure Subscription ✅ RECOMMENDED if you have one

- Skip to "Cost Management Configuration" below
- Use your existing subscription for all course exercises
- Set up course-specific resource group to keep learning resources separate
- Configure billing alerts for the course budget

#### Option B: Create a Free Azure Account ✅ RECOMMENDED if you're new to Azure

- Perfect for learning and exploration
- No charges during free trial period ($200 credit)
- Continue with setup steps below

### Free Tier Benefits (Option B)

- $200 credit for first 30 days
- 12 months of free services (App Service, Functions, Storage, etc.)
- Always-free services (Azure Active Directory, etc.)

### Setup Steps (Option B only)

1. Navigate to [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
2. Create account (requires credit card for verification, but won't charge)
3. Complete phone and identity verification
4. Access Azure Portal at [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)

### Cost Management Configuration (BOTH options)

```
⚠️ Set up billing alerts BEFORE creating any resources

1. Navigate to: Cost Management + Billing
2. Create budget: $10 (alert at 50%, 80%, 100%)
3. Create budget: $50 (alert at 80%, 100%)
4. Create budget: $100 (alert at 90%, 100%)
5. Set up email + SMS alerts (dual notification)

Why this matters:
- Protects you from unexpected charges
- Alerts you if you accidentally leave resources running
- Helps track course spending vs other Azure usage
```

### Create Course Resource Group

Create a dedicated [resource group](../GLOSSARY.md#resource-group) to keep all your course resources organized and easy to clean up.

**Naming Convention**: `azure-copilot-course-[your-initials]`
**Region**: Choose closest to you (e.g., eastus, westus, westeurope)

#### Method 1: Azure Portal

1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click **Resource groups** in the left menu (or search for it)
3. Click **+ Create** at the top
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription
   - **Resource group name**: `azure-copilot-course-[YOUR-INITIALS]`
   - **Region**: Select your closest region (e.g., East US, West Europe)
5. Click **Review + create**
6. Click **Create**

#### Method 2: [Azure CLI](../GLOSSARY.md#azure-cli) (Command Line)

```bash
# Login to Azure (if not already logged in)
az login

# Create the resource group
az group create \
  --name azure-copilot-course-[your-initials] \
  --location eastus

# Verify it was created
az group show --name azure-copilot-course-[your-initials]
```

**Tip**: Use the same region throughout the course for better performance and lower data transfer costs.

## Part 2: GitHub Copilot for Azure Installation

### Prerequisites

- VS Code installed
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) subscription (free or paid)
- [GitHub Copilot for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) extension
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed (recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X / Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot for Azure"
4. Install the extension
5. Sign in to Azure when prompted
6. Authorize GitHub Copilot for Azure to access your account

### What You Get

The GitHub Copilot for Azure extension provides:

**[Azure MCP](../GLOSSARY.md#azure-mcp) Tools:**
- Tools for creating and managing Azure resources
- Tools for deploying applications and infrastructure
- Tools for troubleshooting and optimizing resources
- Automatic tool selection when GitHub Copilot is in [agent mode](../GLOSSARY.md#agent-mode)

**What You Can Do with Agent Mode:**

When using **GitHub Copilot in [agent mode](../GLOSSARY.md#agent-mode)** with Azure MCP:
- Create and manage Azure resources with natural language
- Deploy applications and infrastructure
- Configure security and networking
- Generate and execute [Azure CLI](../GLOSSARY.md#azure-cli) commands, [Bicep](../GLOSSARY.md#bicep), and [Terraform](../GLOSSARY.md#terraform) templates
- No need to memorize specific tool commands - use natural language with "Azure" in your prompts

### Verification

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code (`Cmd+Shift+I` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Set mode to "Agent" using the dropdown at the bottom of the chat panel
3. Try this prompt:

```
List my Azure subscriptions
```

**Expected**: Agent will list your Azure subscriptions

### How to Access Azure MCP

Throughout this course, you'll interact with Azure MCP through **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code:

**Opening GitHub Copilot Chat**:
- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Cmd+Shift+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux)
- **Or**: Click the Copilot icon in the Activity Bar → Open Chat

---

## Part 2a: How to Use Agent Mode

**Agent mode** is how you'll create, deploy, and manage Azure resources throughout this course.

### How to Activate Agent Mode

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code (`Cmd+Shift+I` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Click the mode dropdown at the bottom of the chat panel
3. Select **Agent**

### How to Use Agent Mode

Type natural language prompts with "Azure" somewhere in the prompt. GitHub Copilot automatically selects the right Azure MCP tools.

**Example**:
```
Create a storage account named mystorageacct in East US using Standard_LRS with blob public access disabled and HTTPS-only enabled
```

**What happens**:
1. Agent generates infrastructure-as-code (Bicep templates, Azure CLI commands, etc.)
2. Agent asks for your approval with an "Allow" button
3. After approval, agent automatically executes terminal commands
4. Commands create/modify Azure resources in your subscription
5. Agent reports success and shows what was created

**Important**: You'll see "Allow" buttons before major actions. Always review what the agent plans to do before clicking Allow.

---

### Understanding the Agent Mode Workflow

**The complete workflow looks like this**:

```
You: "Create an Azure storage account in East US"
  ↓
Agent: Analyzes request, generates Bicep template
  ↓
Agent: Shows preview and asks "Allow?"
  ↓
You: Review and click "Allow"
  ↓
Agent: Executes `az deployment create...` in terminal
  ↓
Terminal: Creates actual Azure resources
  ↓
Agent: Reports success, shows resource details
```

**Key Points**:
- Agent mode generates code AND executes it (with your approval)
- You control when actions happen via "Allow" buttons
- Agent automatically selects the right Azure tools based on your prompt

---

## Part 3: Understanding How GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Works with Azure

### How Agent Mode Creates Resources

GitHub Copilot in **agent mode** uses **[Azure MCP](../GLOSSARY.md#azure-mcp)** tools to create Azure resources through a **[Generate → Approve → Execute Workflow](../GLOSSARY.md#generate--approve--execute-workflow)**:

1. **Generate**: Agent creates [infrastructure-as-code](../GLOSSARY.md#infrastructure-as-code-iac) ([Bicep](../GLOSSARY.md#bicep), [Terraform](../GLOSSARY.md#terraform), CLI commands)
2. **Approve**: You review and click "Allow" buttons to approve actions
3. **Execute**: Agent runs terminal commands that create resources in Azure
4. **Verify**: You confirm resources were created correctly

**This is powerful and requires understanding the approval workflow.**

### The agent mode Workflow

```
You: "Create an Azure storage account named mystorageacct in East US"
  ↓
Agent (in agent mode): Analyzes request, generates Bicep template
  ↓
Agent: Shows you the template and asks "Allow?"
  ↓
You: Review the code and click "Allow"
  ↓
Agent: Executes `az deployment create...` in your terminal
  ↓
Terminal Commands: Create actual Azure resources
  ↓
You: Verify in Azure Portal and Azure CLI
  ↓
Resources: Live and running in your subscription
```

### What agent mode Can Do

When you're in agent mode with "Azure" in your prompt, the agent can:

**Resource Management**
```
Create a storage account named mystorageacct in East US
Deploy a Node.js web app with B1 tier
Update my app service to use Node 22
Delete resource group my-test-rg
```

**Querying and Information**
```
List all AKS clusters in my subscription
Show me all storage accounts in East US
What resources are in my resource group?
```

**Troubleshooting**
```
Why is my app service slow?
My web app returns 500 errors - help me troubleshoot
Investigate high costs in my subscription
```

### Verification Methods

After agent mode creates resources, always verify:

**Method 1: Azure Portal** (Visual Confirmation)
```
1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to Resource Group
3. Verify resource exists and is running
4. Check configuration settings
```

**Method 2: Azure CLI** (Programmatic Verification)
```bash
# Verify resource group
az group show --name my-resource-group

# Verify storage account
az storage account show --name mystorageacct

# List all resources in a group
az resource list --resource-group my-resource-group --output table
```

**Method 3: agent mode Query** (Quick Check)
```
List all resources in resource group my-resource-group
Show details of storage account mystorageacct
```

### Course Convention

- **All Chapters**: Use agent mode for creating and managing resources
- Always verify resources after creation (Portal, CLI, or Agent queries)
- Always review what an Azure MCP tool will do before clicking "Allow" in agent mode
- Practice safe approval habits in every chapter

## Part 4: Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard for connecting AI systems to tools and data sources. Think of it like USB-C for AI—a universal connector that works across different tools and platforms.

### MCP in GitHub Copilot for Azure

- GitHub Copilot for Azure extension provides Azure MCP tools
- When you use GitHub Copilot in **agent mode**, it can automatically select Azure MCP tools based on your natural language prompts
- MCP handles the communication between Copilot and Azure APIs
- This abstraction makes Azure expertise accessible through natural language

### Why This Matters

- **Portability**: Skills transfer to other MCP-enabled tools
- **Consistency**: Same patterns work across Azure services
- **Future-proof**: MCP is becoming an industry standard
- **Extensibility**: More Azure tools will support MCP over time

### What You Don't Need to Know

- MCP protocol details (abstracted away)
- JSON-RPC specifications (handled automatically)
- Server implementation (GitHub Copilot for Azure handles this)

## Part 5: First Hands-On Exercise

### Exercise 1: Practice agent mode with Queries

Let's start with safe query operations that don't create any resources.

#### Step 1: Activate agent mode

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (`Cmd+Shift+I` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. Click the mode dropdown at the bottom of the chat panel
3. Select "Agent"

#### Step 2: Query Your Subscription

Use this prompt in agent mode:

```
List all resource groups in my Azure subscription
```

**What happens**: Agent mode will query your Azure subscription and return the results.

**Tool limit exceeded error?**: If you see a message about tool limits, select the `tools` icon at the bottom of the chat panel and deselect any unnecessary tools.

#### Step 3: Review the Results

The agent will show you:
- Resource group names
- Locations
- Tags (if any)
- Subscription information

Both methods should show the same resources!

---

### Exercise 2: Practice Additional agent mode Queries

Try these query prompts in agent mode:

```
List all storage accounts in my Azure subscription

Show details of resource group [YOUR-RG-NAME]

What Azure App Services are running in East US?
```

**These queries don't create or modify anything - perfect for learning!**

**What to notice**:
- Agent automatically selects the right Azure tools
- You just use natural language with "Azure" context
- No need for `#` or `@` prefixes in Agent mode
