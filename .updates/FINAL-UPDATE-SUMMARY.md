| Mode 1: Direct Resource Creation | agent mode |
| Mode 2: Ask Questions | ask mode (with @azure) |
| Mode 3: Generate Commands | Removed (not needed) |
| Azure MCP will | agent mode will |
| Prompt → Create → Verify | Generate → Approve → Execute → Verify |

## Pattern Applied Throughout

**Before:**
```markdown
**Azure MCP will**:
- Create the resource
- Configure settings
- Return confirmation
```

**After:**
```markdown
**agent mode will**:
1. Generate infrastructure code → Show "Continue?" → Execute after approval
2. Create the resource with your settings
3. Configure settings and return confirmation
```

---

## Verification

Run these commands to verify no old terminology remains:

```bash
# Should return no results:
grep -r "Azure MCP will" --include="*.md" | wc -l
grep -r "directly creat" --include="*.md" -i | wc -l
grep -r "#azure_generate_azure_cli_command" --include="*.md" | wc -l

# Should only find one instance in the plan file (which is correct):
grep -r "directly creates" --include="*.md" -i
```

## Course Now Accurately Reflects

1. ✅ **agent mode** is the primary mode for actions
2. ✅ **ask mode** (with `@azure`) is for learning
3. ✅ **Approval gates** ("Continue" buttons) are required
4. ✅ **Generate → Approve → Execute → Verify** workflow
5. ✅ Users review code before execution
6. ✅ No tool-specific commands needed in agent mode
7. ✅ Natural language with "Azure" context automatically selects tools

---

## Migration Complete

All course materials now accurately reflect how GitHub Copilot for Azure agent mode actually works, based on official Microsoft documentation research completed on 2025-10-20.

The course is ready for students to learn the correct workflow with proper expectations about approval gates and the code review process.
